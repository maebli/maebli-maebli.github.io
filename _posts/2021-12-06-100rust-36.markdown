## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original post](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 36th Challenge
### Challenge

Today I'm solving today's [AoC day 6 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6).


### Solution :white_check_mark:

Ok, maybe slightly different approach of learning today. I'm going to look at the functions used by other rust solutions before starting. If I don't know them I will learn their meaning
before I start. Lets take a look at the [Reddit Mega Thread for Day 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/r9z49j/2021_day_6_solutions/)

Skimming through the thread I found the following functional calls:

	{% highlight rust %}

	std::intrinsics::copy

	x.rotate_left(1)
	x..or_insert(0)
	include_str!("")

	use itertools::{iterate, Itertools};
	x.for_each()
	bench()

 	let mut state = [0u64; 9];

	{% endhighlight %}
