## What is this :grey_question: 

The rules of the game are explained [in my original post](https://maebli.github.io/rust/2021/10/18/100rust.html). 

## 48th Challenge
### Challenge

Learn to use neovim to as an alternative IDE as opposed to Intellj. I have been teaching myself VIM and have sen lots of examples of developers using vim to program rust. 


### Solution :white_check_mark:

(1) Use Neovim
(2) Use https://vim-bootstrap.com/ for settingn my config file for rust
